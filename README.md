# INTRODUCTION
This project is our first technical test for you, our future KFit engineer.
Your job is to write a Ruby script to scrape KFit partners in Kuala Lumpur and store the result in CSV file.

# INSTRUCTION
Clone this repo.

Create your own feature branch.

Store these details in the CSV file:
`city, partner name, address, latitude, longitude, average rating`

Save the script as `get_kfit.rb` and output the result to `kfit_partners.csv`. We should be able to run it with this command `ruby get_kfit.rb`. 

Make as many commits as needed.

When you are ready, make a pull request in Github.

# BONUS POINT
Yes, we have hidden level! For the bonus point, include partner's `phone number` in the CSV file.
